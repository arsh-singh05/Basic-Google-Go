### Functions
This folder contains examples and explanations of functions in Go.

Functions in Go are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values.

The examples in this folder cover topics such as:
 - How to create and call functions in Go
 - How to use parameters and return values
 - How to use anonymous functions and closures
 - Best practices for writing functions in Go

Functions in Go are used to organize and reuse code.
Go supports both named and anonymous functions.
Functions can take zero or more arguments, and can return one or more values.
Go supports the use of closures to capture variables from the surrounding scope.

By studying the examples in this folder, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to use interfaces and functions in Go and be able to write more efficient and maintainable code.
