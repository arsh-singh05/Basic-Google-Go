Conditional statements can be used to control the flow of execution and to make decisions based on the values of variables.

 - The if-else statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
 - The switch statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. It can match multiple values, and it has a default case.
 - The ternary operator ? : is a shorthand for an if-else statement and can be used for simple conditions.

In summary, Conditional statements in Go allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables, it includes if-else, switch and the ternary operator (? :). They are a fundamental concept for creating dynamic and flexible programs in Go.
