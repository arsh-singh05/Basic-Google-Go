File handling in Go is used to read and write data to files.

Go provides a built-in package called os which has functions to work with files, like Open, Create, Read, Write, Close.

Go also provides a higher-level package called ioutil which has functions to read and write files more easily.

Go has built-in support for reading and writing CSV, JSON and XML formatted files as well.
