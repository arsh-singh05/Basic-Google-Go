## Interfaces in Go
This folder contains examples and explanations of interfaces in Go.

Interfaces in Go allow you to define a contract for the behavior of a type without specifying the implementation. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse.

The examples in this folder cover topics such as:
 - How to create and use interfaces in Go
 - How to implement an interface on a struct
 - How to use interfaces for polymorphism
 - Best practices for using interfaces in Go

Interfaces are a powerful feature of Go and can be used in many different ways to write more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. 
Interfaces in Go are used to define a set of methods that a type must implement.
Interfaces can be used to create more flexible and reusable code.
Interfaces can be used to implement polymorphism and to handle different types of errors.

These examples are just a few of the many ways interfaces can be used to create more advanced programs.
