Variables in Go are used to store and manipulate data in a program.

Go has several built-in types, such as integers (int, int8, int16, int32, int64), floating-point numbers (float32, float64), and strings.

Go also has several composite types, such as arrays and structs, which can be used to group multiple values together.

Go also supports user-defined types through the use of structs and interfaces.
