Welcome to Go Lang Basics, a comprehensive repository designed to help developers learn the Go programming language from scratch. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience with Go, this repository provides a wide range of examples and explanations to help you deepen your understanding of the language. It contains sample code and tutorials for learning the basics of Google Go (Golang). Go is a modern programming language that is simple, efficient, and easy to learn. It is a great choice for building web servers, command-line tools, and other types of software.

Go is a popular programming language that is widely used in industry and has a strong and growing community of developers. It is known for its simplicity, concurrency support, and performance, which makes it a good choice for a variety of applications.

In terms of its future, it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen, but it seems likely that Go will continue to be widely used and remain an important programming language. It has already been adopted by a number of major companies and organizations, and its popularity appears to be growing. That being said, it is always important to stay up to date with the latest developments in the field and be open to learning new languages and technologies as needed. It is a good idea to regularly review and evaluate your tools and technologies to ensure that you are using the best ones for your needs. Some advantages of using Go include:

1. Efficient concurrency
2. Fast compilation
3. Simple syntax
4. Strong static typing
5. Good performance
6. Growing ecosystem
7. Widely used in industry

### Getting Started
To get started with Go, you'll need to download and install the Go distribution for your operating system. The latest version of Go can be downloaded from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/)

Once you have Go installed, you can use the go command to run Go programs and the go build command to build Go programs. You can also use the go run command to run Go programs without building them first.

### Tutorials
The tutorials in this repository cover the following topics:
 - [Variables and Types](https://github.com/arsh-singh05/Basic-Google-Go-Lang/tree/main/Hello%20World): Learn how to declare and use variables in Go, and how to work with different types of data such as integers, strings, and booleans.
 - [Control Flow](https://github.com/arsh-singh05/Basic-Google-Go-Lang/tree/main/Control%20Flow): Learn how to use for loops, and other control flow constructs to control the flow of execution in a Go program.
 - [Conditional Statemets](https://github.com/arsh-singh05/Basic-Google-Go-Lang/tree/main/Conditional%20Statements): Learn how to use if-else statements and other conditional statement constructs to control the flow of execution in a Go program.
 - [Functions](https://github.com/arsh-singh05/Basic-Google-Go-Lang/tree/main/Functions): Learn how to define and call functions in Go, and how to work with function arguments and return values.
 - [Arrays](https://github.com/arsh-singh05/Basic-Google-Go-Lang/tree/main/Array): Learn how to work with arrays in Go, including how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays.
