## Pointers in Go
Pointers are a fundamental concept in Go programming language and provide a way to directly access and manipulate the underlying value of a variable.

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. The & operator is used to get the address of a variable, and the * operator is used to dereference a pointer and access the underlying value.

Pointers can be used to pass variables by reference to a function, allowing the function to directly modify the underlying value. They can also be used to create linked lists and concurrent safe data structures.

When using pointers, it is important to keep in mind that Go does not have automatic garbage collection for pointers, so it is the developer's responsibility to manage the memory and avoid creating memory leaks.
