## Control flow in Go 

It is used to control the execution of a program.

Control flow in Go refers to the order in which statements in a program are executed. Go provides several control flow statements such as for, while, break, continue, and goto.

 - The for loop is the most commonly used loop in Go. It can be used to iterate over an array, a slice, a map, a string or a range.
 - The while loop is similar to the for loop, but the condition is checked before executing the loop.
 - The break and continue statements can be used to control the flow of a loop. break statement is used to exit the loop and continue statement is used to skip the current iteration.
 - The goto statement is used to transfer control to another labeled statement in the same function.

In summary, Control flow statements in Go are used to control the order of execution of statements in a program, it includes for, while, break, continue, and goto. They are a fundamental concept for creating dynamic and structured programs in Go.
